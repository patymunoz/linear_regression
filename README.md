# Linear regression

[![Binder]()

## Introduction

This is an application of lineal simple and multiple regression to analize a problem. 

The data used in this example is from scikit-learn library "7.13. Diabetes dataset" from Bradley Efron, Trevor  Hastie, Iain Johnstone  and Robert Tibshirani (2004) "Least Angle Regression," Annals of Statistics (with discussion), 407-499. The data is also available in the UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes.

We will see the basics of regression. We will see the difference between simple and multiple regression, how to interpret the results, how to evaluate the model and how to use it to predict new values.

## Dependencies

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## How to run the code

It is recommended to run the code in a virtual environment.

1. To create a virtual environment, I recommend:

```
python install -r requirements.txt
```

But you can install the libraries manually if you want. Only be sure to install the libraries in the same version as the ones in the requirements.txt file and use **python 3.9**.

2. Run the code

There are *n* notebooks that you can run:
